For products that have properties like GB capacity or speeds of any kind. Include this both in the name and as separate property with value. This also goes for memory
For storage make it an array containing the drives. 1 drive per array index.
Put all PHYSICAL hardware products as properties under the 'server' object. This includes things like CPU, MEMORY, STORAGE. It is very important to only put all HARDWARE under the server object.
PHYSICAL hardware products do NOT include things like traffic, DDOS shield or locations or other kind of services or features. These are normal products with their own object
For all physical hardware products make an array containing the product(s) even if it is only a single product.
All product types are in uppercase.

For example :
'Uplink: 100Mbit/s Premium Network
2x 120GB Samsung SSD
2x Intel Xeon E3-1225v6 3.30GHz
Payment every 6 months
8GB ECC DDR3 RAM
50TB Traffic per month
Server voor eigen cloud omgeving.'

Will output:
